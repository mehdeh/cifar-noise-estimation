# Auto Commit Summary Rule
When you complete ANY coding work (file edits, creation, deletion), you MUST end your final response with a git commit message summary following this EXACT format:

```
type(scope): brief description in lowercase

- List of specific changes made
- Each change on a new line with bullet point
- Maximum 3-5 bullet points
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style/formatting changes
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)

# Comments and Documentation
- All comments and docstrings MUST be written in English/Latin only

# Conda Environment Activation
Before executing ANY Python code in the terminal, you MUST first activate the conda environment using:
```bash
eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)" && conda activate myenv
```
This applies to all terminal commands that run Python scripts, including but not limited to:
- Training commands (python main.py train)
- Testing/evaluation commands (python main.py test)
- Any other Python script execution
- Python REPL or interactive commands

Example of correct usage:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/cifar-noise-estimation && eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)" && conda activate myenv && python main.py train
```
